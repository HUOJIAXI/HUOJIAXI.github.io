**I am currently an engineer specializing in control algorithms at the China Academy of Space Technology Hangzhou Institute.**

I am passionate about developing robust and efficient robot systems capable of achieving different mission objectives. My research interests include **multi-robot path planning**, **SLAM**, and **robot control**. 

I hold a **bachelor's** degree in **Automation** from **Zhejiang University** (2020), and a **general engineer degree** from **Ecole Centrale de Lille** (2018-2020) as a double degree student. I subsequently completed a **master's degree** in **Electrical Engineering** at **Zhejiang University** in March 2023, under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Ronghao Zheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ronghaozheng).

Selected Research
-------
**2023-NOW** **All-terrain 4WIS4WID autonomous mobile robot system**  
Aiming at complex mission scenarios, we develop a all-terrain 4-wheel-steering-4-wheel-driving (4WIS4WID) robot system and independently develop key technologies such as chassis control algorithms, navigation algorithms and autonomous charging algorithms.  

**2022-2023** **Intelligent wheeled inspection robot system**  
We built a robot simulation platform and physical platform based on ROS and Gazebo. We independently developed a full set of robot navigation algorithms, including multi-threaded dynamic path planning algorithms and high-precision path tracking algorithms, with positioning accuracy within ±2cm, to achieve cross-floor and cross-room inspections.  

**2023-2023** **Lunar exploration quadruped robot**  
Deeply involved in the research and development of quadruped robot projects for lunar exploration missions, mainly involved in the development of algorithms related to the navigation system (LIO-SAM and RRT applied).  

**2023-2023** **Research on distributed planning problem of multi-robot systems for collaborative tasks (Bachelor's and master's thesis**  
We propose the two-layer multi-robot path planning framework and control algorithm. Compared with the current mainstream multi-robot path planning algorithm, it has higher solution efficiency in high-density industrial warehousing environments.
