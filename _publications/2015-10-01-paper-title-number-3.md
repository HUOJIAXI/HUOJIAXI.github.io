Scheduling collision-free paths for a large number
of robots in dense environments with high effciency is achieved
in this work. We propose an algorithm, OMPP (One-way Multi-robot Path Planning), using a new topological skeleton representation of the dense environment by introducing the particular
collision-free traffc rules. We propose the integer programming
technique based on the topological skeleton graph to tackle the
multi-robot path planning optimization problem using distance
metrics. We realize two practical achievements in solving multi-robot path planning problems in dense environments: collision-free robotic path generation and an effcient solving process. We
have performed numerous simulations. According to the extensive
simulation data, our algorithm suggests a higher overall performance in dense environments than the existing representative
algorithms.
