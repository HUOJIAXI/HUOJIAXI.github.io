Collision-free path planning is indispensable for the multi-robot system. Many existing multi-robot path planning algorithms
may no longer work properly in the narrow-lane environment. We propose in this paper a dual-layer algorithm to deal
with the multi-robot path planning problem in the narrow-lane environment. In the first layer, the integer programming
technique primarily based on distance metrics balances the optimality of the generated collision-free paths and the computation
time of the algorithm. In the second layer, fast feasible heuristics are applied to make sure the solvability of the proposed
integer programming approach in the first layer. In the dual-layer algorithm, specific traffic policies for each narrow lane are implemented to generate a collision-free path for every robot while maintaining the narrow lane free, besides the collision avoidance approach at the robotic level. With this, inter-robot collision in the narrow lane is avoided, and the algorithmâ€™s efficiency in producing collision-free paths increases. Simulations have been launched considerably based on the proposed assessment metrics. According to the extensive simulation data, our algorithm suggests a higher overall performance in the narrow-lane environment when in contrast with the present optimal, sub-optimal, and polynomial-complexity algorithms.
